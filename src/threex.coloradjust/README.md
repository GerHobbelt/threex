threex.coloradjust
===================

It is a 
[threex](http://jeromeetienne.github.io/threex/) extension 
for 
[three.js](http://threejs.org)
which provide an coloradjust for other developpers.
Thus they can copy it and start their own extension.

Show Don't Tell

\[[view source](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/threex.coloradjust/blob/master/examples/basic.html)\] :
It shows how to use the ```THREEx.ColorAdjust.Renderer```.
It changes the color cube randomly every 3-seconds just to put some animations

It does that this way, and it is cool in that case.

How To Install It
=================

You can install it via script tag

```html
<script src='threex.coloradjust.js'></script>
```

Or you can install with [bower](http://bower.io/), as you wish.

```bash
bower install threex.coloradjust
```

How To Use It
=============

there is no real use as it is only a boilerplate for your own extension.

```javascript
var instance	= new THREEx.Sample()
```
